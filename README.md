## What is this all about?

Are you studying for an exam? Do you like to use flashcards as a memory techni-
que but hate the act of writing them down? Fret not, fellow student, here you'll
find all tools necessary to make and use your very own flashcards without the
hassle of getting ink on your hands.

This python3 script prints questions to your console followed by a prompt (in
which you can enter whatever you like) and then the answer. Just like real-life
flashcards. This script has been heavily inspired by Zed Shaw's Learn Python 3
the Hard Way (https://learncodethehardway.org/python/).

## What do I need?

Easy, apart from python3 you just need your very own json-File containing the
Question and Answer pairs you wish. For an example (if you don't already know
what a json-file is) consider looking at the example_dict.json-file which is
provided in the repository.

## How do I run it?

First of all: you have to run this on your console. No Spyder, no notebook. Just
the console. Make sure you are on your correct directory and run:  
```python3.6 py_flash.py path_to_your_json```  

A working example is:  
```python3.6 py_flash.py example_dict.json```  

## How do I stop it?

To stop it just press ```CTRL-D```.
